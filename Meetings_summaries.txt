In today's meeting, our group members took the planning poker and decided the level of difficulty of each of the eight task. 
We have assigned more specific missions to each one of us with the consideration of layout design of the android app. 
Desbite the slice disagreement on choosing the level of work, we all shared our idea in testing, coding habits, handover of tasks and many other aspects. 
Aside from that, we even looked an example of a designning of a website to enhance our understanding in this project in terms of the GUI. 
Schedules next meeting next Mon. Possibly smaller meetings without all memebers attending during the weekend.
